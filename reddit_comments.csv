1n7knhc,"Here's the thing guys. We already have court documents from 2016 accusing both Donald Trump and Epstein together of sexually assaulting minors.

We have video deposition of testimony of the abuse. 

We have video and audio recording of Jeffrey Epstein himself talking about how he was best friends with Donald Trump for 10 years, and how Donald Trump would blackmail his own friends to sleep with their wives.

The Maga cult does not care. The Republicans are dealing with the albatross of their own making, because they made a big deal about these lies to their base, but they also believe their base is dumber than a box of rocks because they're now selling the story that it's a democrat hoax .

These are the same people that went against medical expertise and advice, telling their own supporters to go out and vote in person during a deadly pandemic. 

These are the people that are cutting healthcare from rural communities to give tax cuts to corporations that don't need it.

The base does not revolt because all of the culture war red meat they have been fed through their media ecosystem tells them trans people are going to destroy the world.

These are the same people that waffle on the efficacy of vaccines, that their own administration developed. 

These people do not think critically about the world they live in, they are fiercely partisan to the point of ignoring evidence they find inconvenient.

They have successfully Weaponized blissful ignorance.",1863

1n7u4w0,If I had a dime...,1
1n7u4w0,"The thing is, Donald Trump always knows he's going down. He always *believes* he's going down, and he's been that way for most of his life. 

He doesn't know why he succeeds. He truly doesn't. His inexplicable twists of fortune are as much a mystery to him as they are to everyone else.

Just look at him bribing Stormy Daniels in 2010s. This is a perfect example of him doing a really fucking dumb thing because he categorically misunderstands the people who support him and the forces buoying him, and doing the worst possible thing in the stupidest possible way, and getting away with it for no other reason than extraordinary luck.

People seem to think that Trump is aware of, and luxuriates in, his apparently invincibility. But it's the exact opposite. He lives in perpetual fear and paranoia. 

If he truly grasped and embraced his apparent invulnerability, he wouldn't have tried to cover up the Stormy Daniels affair. After all, as is very clear, the knowledge of that affair would probably have INCREASED his standing with his MAGA base, or at the very least, they would have been indifferent to it. 

Instead, he spent six figures and exposed himself to criminal liability to try and ""kill' the story. 

Everything he does, everything he has done for a decade and longer, is the actions of a man far out of his depths, scared and floundering as he's surrounded by dangers he doesn't comprehend, and often spared from said dangers by twists of luck and fortune that he clearly doesn't understand and never believes will save him, yet always does.

If we were to compare Donald Trump to a fictional character, the best approximate would be Forrest Gump. 

Trump is basically the evil twin of Forrest Gump. He's a man of profoundly limited intellect, who simply blunders unwittingly through all the many major geopolitical events of his time. He strikes outrageous fortune over and over and over again, without ever actually understanding why. 

When he does consciously attempt to take action, it's always the stupidest possible move he could choose to make, which he makes BECAUSE he's the stupidest possible person in the public stage, and it simply works, not for any reason he or any of us understand, but because he's just this dim-witted, savage, evil human being surfing on the far tail-end of some universal bell curve of outrageous luck, unaware how he got there, or why he's there, and perpetually terrified it will suddenly crash and throw him off.

Like, if you really, truly go back and just look at his improbable life, it's honestly a little hard to even condemn him for being the way he is. 

He may be one of the luckiest human beings on the planet. He has spoiled or ruined so many fortunes, only to simply be handed another one by outrageous, insane amounts of luck. 

Everything he consciously does is the worst thing anyone could do in that situation, and it just simply keeps working. In ways no one can predict, for reasons literally no one understands, least of all him, because he's a moron.",1
